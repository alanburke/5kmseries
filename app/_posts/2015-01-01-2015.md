Even a royal cavalcade couldn\'t stop the 5km series going ahead. A tougher course than last week led to slower times overall, but the rain mainly held off. Onwards to the [airport!](/#galway-city) next week.

A return to the Craughwell course on a fine, clear but cold evening. The stronger winds held off and some good times were recorded. The better weather attracted out a very respectable 700 finishers.

A cold evening again in Loughrea didn\'t deter runners eager to test the new course right through the centre of the town. The gusty wind blowing down the main street put paid to many people\'s hopes for fast times on what should be a fast course. Perhaps next year!

The 5km series kicked off in Athenry with the wintry weather failing to deter the hardy runners. 
Over 700 finishers made for a packed run around the edge of Athenry town, and as usual, the race went off without a hitch.
