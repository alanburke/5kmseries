Updates

- We're up and running for 2019.
- An excellent evening for running with a very big welcome in Caltra for a near record number of finishers. It was a fast course with some very fine times recorded across the field.
- A muggy evening in Craughwell, but the rain held off to allow for some fast running, and good times.

About the race series
---------------------

The County Galway 5km series, is an initative of the Galway Athletic Clubs. Over 6 Tuesday nights, a 5km race is organised by one of the athletic clubs across the county. The format is simple - one race number covers the entire series. No prizes are awarded, but anyone who completes 4 of the 6 races gets a souvenir race t-shirt. After the last race, a social night is organised by the final host club.

The series has exploded in popularity over the years, to the point where entry sells out in a matter of minutes.

All proceed of the 5k series goes to fund juvenile and adult athletics in Galway.

*Please car pool to venues - parking is strictly limited at all venues!*
