- [Enter online here](http://www.active.com/galway-galway/running/distance-running-races/5km-series-2017) when entry opens.
- Ensure that you are already registered with Active.com as that process alone can be time consuming and may result in you not getting entered in time via this mechanism.

- Note - Start time of first race is _7:30_!
- Andrew Tablot from Clare River Harriers is the new man in charge for the 2017s.
- We'll kick off in Galway city, at the racecourse, this time, and finish up in Athenry.
- One notable change is that this year Tuam will not be hosting a leg this year due to roadworks on their route. Caltra will be taking their leg for this year.

About the race series
---------------------

The County Galway 5km series, sponsored by [Bradley Renault](http://bradleyrenault.ie/), is an initative of the Galway Athletic Clubs. Over 6 Tuesday nights, a 5km race is organised by one of the athletic clubs across the county. The format is simple - one race number covers the entire series. No prizes are awarded, but anyone who completes 4 of the 6 races gets a souvenir race t-shirt. After the last race, a social night is organised by the final host club.

The series has exploded in popularity over the years, to the point where entry sells out in a matter of minutes.

All proceed of the 5k series goes to fund juvenile and adult athletics in Galway.

*Please car pool to venues - parking is strictly limited at all venues!*
